title: components.json
description: Configuration for your project.
---

The `components.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

> Note: The `components.json` file is optional
> It is only required if you're using the CLI to add components to your project. If you're using the copy and paste method, you don't need this file.

You can create a `components.json` file in your project by running the following command:

<CodeBlockCommand command="headcn@latest init" />

See the [CLI section](/docs/cli) for more information.

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for components.json [here](https://ui.headcn.site/schema.json).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.headcn.site/schema.json"
}
```

## style

The style for your components. Will support more styles in future versions.

```json
{
  "style": "default"
}
```

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the [installation](/docs/installation) section for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

### tailwind.css

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "styles/global.css"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.prefix

The prefix to use for your Tailwind CSS utility classes. Components will be added with this prefix.

```json
{
  "tailwind": {
    "prefix": "tw-"
  }
}
```

## rsc

Whether or not to enable support for React Server Components.

The CLI automatically adds a `use client` directive to client components when set to `true`.

```json
{
  "rsc": true | false
}
```

## tsx

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript components.

Setting this option to `false` allows components to be added as JavaScript with the `.jsx` file extension.

```json
{
  "tsx": true | false
}
```

## aliases

The CLI uses these values and the paths config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated components in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

> Important: If you're using the src directory, make sure it is included under paths in your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file.

### aliases.components

Import alias for your components.

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components"
  }
}
```

### aliases.ui

Import alias for `ui` components.

The CLI will use the `aliases.ui` value to determine where to place your `ui` components. Use this config if you want to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "ui": "@/app/ui"
  }
}
```

### aliases.lib

Import alias for `lib` functions such as `utils`.

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "lib": "@/lib"
  }
}
```
