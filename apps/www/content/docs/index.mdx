title: Introduction
description: headcn/ui is a collection of beautifully designed and ready to use Headless UI components - with a CLI to add them instantly. It’s inspired by shadcn/ui but embraces the Headless UI philosophy, giving you full control over markup, styles, and behavior.

This is not just a component library.

It’s a toolkit for building your own component library - one that perfectly matches your design system, accessibility needs, and development workflow.

## Why?

Most UI libraries work like this:

You install an NPM package, import a component, and use it in your app.
It’s fast to start with, but as soon as you need custom markup, extra accessibility tweaks, or behavior changes, you end up:

- Fighting against the library’s styling system
- Wrapping components with workarounds
- Mixing and matching components from different sources with inconsistent APIs

headcn/ui avoids these problems by giving you the actual component code - unstyled but functional, powered by Headless UI’s accessibility primitives.

## Core Principles

### Open Code

You get the complete, editable source code for every component you install.<br/>
That means:

- **Full transparency** - See exactly how it works.
- **Easy customization** - Change markup, behavior, or styles however you like.
- **Future-proof** - No dependency lock-in- the components live in your project.

### Composition

All components follow a predictable, composable pattern - thanks to `@headlessui/react`.<br/>
This makes them:

- Consistent to use across your app
- Easy to extend with custom logic
- Flexible enough to integrate with other libraries

### Distribution

The CLI isn’t just for installing components - it’s a **component distribution system**.<br/>
It works by:

- Using a flat-file schema (`components.json`) to describe components, dependencies, and styles
- Letting you share components across projects or teams
- Making it easy to keep components updated

### Beautiful Defaults

While components are unstyled by default, `headcn/ui` ships with optional Tailwind-based theme styles (`theme.css)` you can use as a starting point.

- Clean, minimal defaults for quick prototyping
- Easy to override to match your brand
- Works seamlessly with Tailwind’s theming system
